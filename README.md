- 👋 Hi, I’m @NacheoBrush
- 👀 I’m interested in personal home gaming that feels like social gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about simplifing code thru the use of readable algorythms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on me not helping by not editing or changing any code or trying to develope code. 
- 📫 How to reach me .. try happy bird calls , but not so real someone shoots you....Just some humour not sarchasm Seriously
                         you most likely are to busy to need to reach me. I am not a very good programmer as I still mostly
                         use QBASIC and 16-bit C++ 11 . I gave up on FORTRAN 77.
